### Goals, Objectives, and User Interactions:

#### Goals:
- **Creation of a Secure and Efficient Payment Processor:** Develop a payment processor that facilitates escrow transactions between users within the LittleBiggy platform.
- **Integration of LittleBiggy API:** Utilize Chainlink or the Solana SDK to create oracles that retrieve specific data from the LittleBiggy API.
- **Smart Contract Development:** Design and implement a smart contract on the Solana blockchain that handles payments based on the retrieved data from the oracles.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Provide a seamless user interface for users to interact with the payment processor, manage transactions, and view payment details.
- **Subgraph:** Create a subgraph to index all events from the smart contract, making it easier to query data and historic transactions.

#### Objectives:
- **Oracle Creation:** Develop two distinct oracles â€“ one to fetch and one to provide LittleBiggy API data (order identifier, default release date, default release-to address).
- **Smart Contract Implementation:** Write a Solidity smart contract that receives instructions from oracles and executes tasks like generating new invoice addresses and processing payments accordingly.
- **Integration and Testing:** Integrate oracles with the smart contract and conduct thorough testing to ensure accurate data retrieval and payment execution.

#### User Interactions:
- **Buyers:** Users initiating transactions on LittleBiggy.
- **Sellers:** Individuals selling goods/services on LittleBiggy.
- **Payment Processor Interface:** User-friendly interface allowing buyers to make payments and sellers to receive them, displaying transaction details and invoice generation.

### Role of USD Stable Coins on the Solana Blockchain:

- **Transaction Medium:** USD stable coins on the Solana blockchain serve as a reliable digital representation of US dollars.
- **Reduced Volatility:** Stable coins aim to minimize the price fluctuations seen in cryptocurrencies, offering stability akin to traditional fiat currencies like the US dollar.
- **Efficient Transactions:** They enable faster and cheaper cross-border transactions compared to conventional banking systems.
- **Smart Contract Operations:** USD stable coins facilitate the execution of payment-related smart contracts, ensuring secure and transparent transactions on the Solana blockchain.
- **Integration in Payment Processor:** They become the currency of choice for transactions within the LittleBiggy payment processor, providing a stable and consistent value for purchases and sales on the platform.

In summary, the goal is to create a robust payment processor that leverages the stability and efficiency of USD stable coins on the Solana blockchain to facilitate seamless transactions between buyers and sellers within the LittleBiggy platform, enhancing the overall user experience and transaction security.
